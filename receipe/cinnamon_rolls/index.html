    <h6 class="steps">Steps:</h6>
    <p>1. Make the dough from the ingredients listed above. Gently fold the dough and cover it with plastic
        wrap for ferment. Place the dough at the warmest spot you can find indoors. <br><br>
        2. Start makeing the stuffings. Add the melted butter with ground cinnamon, mix it until well
        blended. Highly recommend those who have tried multiple times to add some apple sauce, it elevates
        the flavor suprisingly! <br> <br>
        3. After finishing the stuffings, take the dough out, and make sure it's rested for at least 1 hour.
        The dough should be at least twice as large. Fold the dough and release the bubbles contained. <br>
        <br>
        4. Shape the dough in a 35*25*2 (length, width, and height), remember not to make the dough too dry
        while shaping. Then spread the stuffings on to the dough. <br> <br>
        5. Roll the dough as if you're rolling paper but extremely gentle. Rest it on the oven plate for
        secondary ferment. In the meantime, pre-heat the
        oven at 180 degrees. <br> <br>
        6. After 30 minutes, bake the dough for 25-35 minutes. After resting in room temperature, add the
        decoration on top of your well-made cinnamon rolls! <br> <br>
